# Introduction

## Definition of Image Denoising
Image denoising is the process of removing unwanted noise from images while preserving essential details. Noise can arise from sensor limitations, environmental interference, or compression artifacts, which degrade the quality of the image. Effective denoising is crucial in fields like medical imaging and digital photography.

## Importance of Image Denoising
One of the key challenges in denoising is distinguishing between noise and fine image details. Excessive smoothing can blur important features, while inadequate noise removal can compromise clarity. Various techniques, from traditional Gaussian filters to advanced machine learning models, aim to balance these trade-offs.

## Overview of the Project
This project evaluates different image denoising algorithms by optimizing their parameters and testing them on a dataset. The goal is to identify the most effective approach under specific conditions and analyze the trade-offs between noise reduction and detail preservation.
